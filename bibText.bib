   abstract = {The development of Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) concrete involves two major concerns: (a) poor strength resulting in the EPS concrete unsuitable for structural applications, and (b) segregation of the ultra-light weight of EPS during mixing (EPS is approximately 100 times lighter than concrete). Though EPS displays high insulation (thermal conductivity ≈ 0.04 W/m-K), these issues limit its usage in concrete. This study aims to develop a lightweight-EPS cement composite (LECC) having enhanced insulating capacity as well as satisfactory compressive strength for structural applications. To mitigate the deteriorating effect of EPS on strength, the LECC is developed using the base material of ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC). EPS beads of 3–5 mm diameter are mixed in UHPC in five proportions by volume of 0, 16, 25, 36, 45% and the resulting composites are tested for mechanical and thermal properties. Microstructural characterization is performed using micro-computed tomography (μCT). The choice of the UHPC ingredients proportion is found successful in achieving a balance between an optimum viscosity and satisfactory workability for uniform dispersion of EPS, confirmed by the flow values and μCT results. McLachlan's general effective media approximation, based on percolation theory, is used to homogenize the composite and estimate its thermal conductivity with satisfactory accuracy. The LECC thus developed displays a strength 45 MPa with a corresponding density of 1677 kg/m3 and thermal conductivity of 0.58 W/m-K.},

   abstract = {In a global context where the need for quality housing is increasing with improved standard of living and growing population, the over exploitation of natural resources as building materials is becoming a serious problem. In this context, the conversion of non-bio degradable waste materials to quality building products would be extremely useful. In this research, the use of mechanically recycled Expanded Polystyrene as 50% of the total EPS used in a composite foam concrete panel has been assessed experimentally. The results of the experimental program have been interpreted with respect to various useful structural behaviors in compression and flexure. It is shown that the use of this foam concrete along with cement fiber boards produces a lightweight wall panel that can be used very effectively for load-bearing walls of single storey houses and non-loadbearing walls of multi-storey buildings. These lightweight panels can allow rapid construction while reducing the overall weight of the building.},
